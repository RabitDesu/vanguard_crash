# Crafters

Hi, I’m Hisato Hasumi.
I like playing Minecraft, especially fan-made content created by other players. I also enjoy using commands because they give me a lot of freedom to control and change the game in creative ways.

During the orientation,
I got to know the people in my room, and we had some great conversations. It was fun to talk and laugh together—it made me feel a lot more comfortable and excited about school.
